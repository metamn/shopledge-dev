<h2>The Short History of Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>
  <a href="{{ page.people[0].url }}" title="{{ page.people[0].name }}">{{ page.people[0].name }}</a> in 
  <a href="{{ page.links[2].url }}" title="{{ page.links[2].title }}">{{ page.links[2].title }}</a> article, back in May 2010 opened my eyes about
  a new, and in the same time old technology capable to produce web sites compatible with various displays like 
  desktop monitors, tablets, smartphones and smaller mobile devices.   
</p> 

<p>
  After reading <a href="{{ page.links[3].url }}" title="{{ page.links[3].title }}">the article</a> I was surprised how
  straightforward and <em>easy</em> is to create responsive web sites.
</p>

<p>
  You just have to use elastic measures (<b>em, %</b>) in your CSS and add two lines of code in your HTML.
  There is a simple magic formula how to size design elements relatively to the current display resolution and that's all,
  the rest is done by the modern browser.
</p>

<p>
  A few months later 
  <a href="{{ page.people[1].url }}" title="{{ page.people[1].name }}">{{ page.people[1].name }}</a>
  the grandpa of all web designers stated 
  <a href="{{ page.links[1].url }}" title="{{ page.links[1].title }}">{{ page.links[1].title }}</a>
  so I was sure I'm on the right track.
</p>

<p>
  With the <a href="{{ page.links[0].url }}" title="{{ page.links[0].title }}">{{ page.links[0].title }}</a>
  Responsive Web Design got full respect and support from the designer elite.
</p>

<p>
  So please forget responsiveness is not the <em>silver bullet</em> &mdash; just flow with the opinion leaders. 
</p>

<p>
  And do not trust ideas like <em>"Mobile Web Design in the Rails Way"</em> &mdash web development frameworks are
  opinionated about development not about design.
</p>

<h2>Yes, The Images</h2>

<p>
  CSS media queries and the flexible grid &mdash the foundation for responsiveness &mdash are dealing with the 
  <em>display size</em> of the HTML elements in a webpage and <em>not</em> with the size of images in kilobytes 
  to be downloaded.
</p>

<p>
  It sounds good to use differently sized (in KB) images for desktop and mobile. You save bandwith and download time.
</p>

<p>
  Probably everybody is already uploading different sizes for images &mdash thumbnail, medium, large &mdash by default. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So it remains to detect run-time &mdash with Javascript and cookies &mdash which image size to use for different displays.

<h3>An example</h3>
<p>
  This very blog uses the responsive technique to stay mobile.
  </br>
  There are three steps to follow:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Tell the browser to reset the viewport.
      <br/>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/803971.js?file=responsive.html"></script>
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the mobile.css when necessary
      <br/>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/804170.js?file=mobile.html"></script>
    </li>  
    <li>
      Create the mobile.css.
    </li>
  </ol>
