excerpt: Writing and maintaing code in HTML/CSS is painful. Designers should learn from peers like Ruby developers who enjoy every part of it.

<h2>Design Is Way Harder Than Development</h2>
<p>
  Writing programs &mdash; in Ruby, PHP, Javascript, etc. &mdash; and designing web sites with
  HTML, CSS and templating languages like Liquid is not the same thing, at all.
</p>

<p>
  Programming languages are older and more advanced than markup and styling languages. They focus on data,
  not humans as in case of web design.
</p>
<p>
  Manipulating code bits living in an abstract but uniform environment &mdash; like the computer &mdash; is easier than 
  manipulating pixels living in the perception of humans, millions of them and all different.
</p>

<p>
  Code and data runs in virtual machines, standard environments when displays vary from mobile handsets to large 
  projector screens, and, web sites are rendered by many different browsers.
</p>

<p>
  Web design is like shooting on moving target; programming, well, is stable, testable, more straightforward.
</p>
  

<h2>Tools And Best Practices From Programmers To Web Designers</h2>
<p>
  Yes, you can do it.
</p>  

<p>
  You'll never have that advanced ecosystem a programming language is equipped with: automated tests,
  intelligent debugger & performance analyser, code coverage tool, documentation generator, frameworks built
  on frameworks, and all.
</p>

<p>
  But you can re-use the <em>principles</em> of creating good code in web design, and, you can adapt some of the 
  <em>tools</em> programmers use. 
</p>
<p>
  A good starting point for analysis could be the 
  <a href="{{ page.links[1].url }}" title="{{ page.links[1].title }}">Ruby programming language</a> and the 
  <a href="{{ page.links[2].url }}" title="{{ page.links[2].title }}">Ruby on Rails web development platform</a>, 
  probably the best tools of the moment for creating web applications:
</p>
  
<h3>1. Human Friendly Code</h3>
<p>
  Ruby was created / optimised for developers, not the machine.
</p>  
<p>
  Programming with Ruby is very straightforward today, the language constructs are so close
  to plain English even a child can understood and use them. 
</p>
<p>
  Ruby code needs no documentation &mdash; it is so elegant it documents itself.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  As a first lesson try to create human friendly, readable, understandable design code which documents itself. 
</p>
<p>
  Make your design your friend. Changing, editing, reviewing, enhancing, extending a Ruby code is always a joy.
  In contrast, your HTML or CSS code will suck after a while even for you, the creator.
</p>
<p class="summary">
  The biggest challenge in web design is to integrate, by innovative and meticulous naming technique the HTML, CSS and Javascript 
  elements into a seamlessly co-working entity. 
</p>
<p>
  Mark your code in a straightforward, easily rememberable way which works in any context assuring the <em>flow</em>. 
  So you don't have to look up different source files to find out how to style, or add interaction to an element.  
</p>

  
<h3>2. Don't Repeat Yourself</h3>
<p>
  Scalability is everything, you know.
</p>
<p>
  This principle turned out to be very strong building the success of the Rails framework.
</p>
<p>
  Rails was created by substracting the essence from a well known, top notch web application (Basecamp) created with Ruby. 
  All best practices were turned into reusable modules forming the framework itself.
</p>
<p>
  Basecamp, thus Rails was continuously refactored and optimised until all fat was trimmed.
  The outcome was the simplest and most robust tool which can be reused, again, to create same successful applications
  in a faster and easier way.
</p>
<p>
  Smart people are maximising the outcome of every work they done. Beside the final product there is always something more
  &mdash; an enhanced tool- and mindset moving them forward to repeat the same / similar task faster and easier.
</p> 
<p>
  They don't repeat themselves. Instead the tool, the framework, the ecosystem they have <em>extracted</em> repeats and embeds 
  automagicaly in every following project all the lessons they've previously learned.
</p>
<p class="summary">
  Web design is lacking similar tools and frameworks. Industry best practices are not extracted into a common 
  knowledge base and then enhanced by a community. Designing for web is not scalable.
</p>



<h3>3. Test Driven Design</h3>
<p>
  I know it sounds impossible. No test tool can <em>see</em> as human eyes do.
</p>
<p>
  But if developers can do it maybe the designers will be able too.
</p>
<p>
  In an ideal scenario &mdash; you have human friendly design code and a powerful design framework built on your best
  knowledge &mdash; you have a strong HTML/CSS/Javascript base at disposal whenever you start a new project.
</p>
<p>
  This framework in order to be perfect must be tested on various browsers, operating systems, display sizes, color depths 
  and so on.
  No testing tool will warn you on bugs like in Webkit if you add newline in your source code for a link the design will broke.

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/867212.js?file=button-webkit.html"></script>
  
  This will cause the following broken button on Webkit browsers (on Firefox all is fine):
  <br/><br/>
  <img src="/images/{{ page.images[0].url }}" alt="{{ page.images[0].title }}" />
</p>

<p class="summary">
  Enter <a href="{{ page.links[0].url }}" title="{{ page.links[0].title }}">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a>. If web designers would unite into a community distilling the best practices into a framework
  using human test power all elements of that framework would be tested, bullet proof, for all browsers and operating systems 
  for nothing.
</p>



<h2>And the tl;dr</h2>
<p>
  Web designers (HTML/CSS programmers) should learn from their developer brothers (coding in Ruby, Python etc.) to make
  designing more enjoyable, more bullet-proof and widely sustained.  
</p>
<p>
  The current web designer elite shares some thoughts on best practices, a few boilerplate code but there are no frameworks
  and ecosystems like in development which creates power both for its creators and users.
</p>
<p class='summary'>
  Both principles and tools can be borrowed / adapted from developers &mdash; what we only need is a charismatic leader
  to become a hero.
