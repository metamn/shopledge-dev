<h2>The Need and the Envy</h2>

<p>
Many times we are looking after some spicey web design, brave idea, tricky people or nifty technique &mdash; to relax and enjoy.
</p>

<p>
If something found it goes directly to Delicious bookmarks tagged properly, containing for sure teh tag <em>inspiration</em>.
</p>

<p>
Browsing bookmarks &mdash; and getting back that feeling when we've bookmarked them &mdash; however is not so pleasant.
</p>

<p>
Recently Delicious introduced a visual tool for showing the webpages under a bookmark but &mdash; we did not get the feeling again.
</p>

<p>
Until 
<a href="{{ page.people[0].url }}" title="{{ page.people[0].name }}">{{ page.people[0].name }}</a>
showed us her 
<a href="{{ page.links[0].url }}" title="{{ page.links[0].title }}">inspirational portfolio</a> yesterday.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="/images/{{ page.images[1].url }}" alt="{{ page.images[1].title }}" />
</p>

<h6>Stunning, isn't?</h6>


<h2>Hack'a'day</h2>

<p>It took a couple of hours to research what's new on the bookmarking scene.</p>

<p>
  We knew Yahoo will abandon 
<a href="{{ page.links[1].url }}" title="{{ page.links[1].title }}">{{ page.links[1].title }}</a>
soon &mdash; as dipshit companies usually do <em>blindly</em> with their <em>values</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately for them, lucky for us, the couple of Delicious replacements we've found were not delivering our expectations,
  except Pinboard.in which is not free. (Which is ok and respectable, probably after shutting down Delicious we will move to Pinboard)
</p>

<p>
  And a new hack'a'day started &mdash writing the core code took less time than looking for alternatives.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="{{ page.links[3].url }}" title="{{ page.links[3].title }}">source code</a> 
  with guidelines is up on Github, grab it, use it and fork it.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="{{ page.links[2].url }}" title="{{ page.links[2].title }}">result</a> 
  is on our mother's page &mdash; not so shiny like Veerle's &mdash; but works for now.
</p>


<h2>Mashing Up The Flow</h2>

<p>
  It seems the <a href="http://dev.shopledge.com/2011/01/12/the-easiest-way-to-blog.html">Jekyll conspiration</a>
  had success on us.
</p>

<p>
  Leaving servers alone and processing locally information, then uploading the barebones result, then serving it fast,
  then ..., 
</p>

<p>
And meantime having fun, learning, hacking, giving back to community &mdash; it's more than the future of software development.
</p>

  Mashing up makes you a better man.
