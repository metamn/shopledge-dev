<h2>The Need and the Envy</h2>

<p>
Many times we are looking after some spicey web design, brave idea, tricky people or nifty technique &mdash; to relax and enjoy.
</p>

<p>
If something found it goes directly to Delicious bookmarks tagged properly, containing for sure teh tag <em>inspiration</em>.
</p>

<p>
Browsing bookmarks &mdash; and getting back that feeling we've got when bookmarked them &mdash; however is not so awesome.
</p>

<p>
Recently Delicious introduced a visual tool for showing the website of the bookmarked URL but &mdash; we did not get the feeling again.
</p>

<p>
Until 
<a href="{{ page.people[0].url }}" title="{{ page.people[0].name }}">{{ page.people[0].name }}</a>
showed us her 
<a href="{{ page.links[0].url }}" title="{{ page.links[0].title }}">inspirational portfolio</a> yesterday.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="/images/{{ page.images[1].url }}" alt="{{ page.images[1].title }}" />
</p>

<h6>Stunning, isn't?</h6>


<h2>Hack'a'day</h2>

<p>It took a couple of hours to research what's hot on the bookmarking scene.</p>

<p>
  We knew Yahoo will abandon 
<a href="{{ page.links[1].url }}" title="{{ page.links[1].title }}">{{ page.links[1].title }}</a>
soon &mdash; as dipshit companies usually do <em>blindly</em> with their <em>values</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately for them, lucky for us, the couple of Delicious replacements we've found were not delivering the expectations,
  except Pinboard.in which is not free. 
</p>

<p>
  (Which is ok and respectable, probably after shutting down Delicious we will move to Pinboard)
</p>

<p>
  And a new hack'a'day started &mdash writing the core code took less time than looking for alternatives.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="{{ page.links[3].url }}" title="{{ page.links[3].title }}">source code</a> 
  with guidelines is up on Github, grab it, use it and fork it.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="{{ page.links[2].url }}" title="{{ page.links[2].title }}">result</a> 
  is on our mother's page &mdash; not so shiny like Veerle's &mdash; but works for now.
</p>


<h2>Mashing Up The Flow</h2>

<p>
  It seems the <a href="http://dev.shopledge.com/2011/01/12/the-easiest-way-to-blog.html">Jekyll conspiration</a>
  had success on us.
</p>

<p>
  Leaving servers alone and processing locally information, then uploading the barebones result, then serving it fast,
  then ... 
</p>

<p>
And meantime having fun, learning, hacking, giving back to community &mdash; it's more than the future of software development.
</p>

<h6 class="summary">
  Mashing up makes you a better (meta)man.
